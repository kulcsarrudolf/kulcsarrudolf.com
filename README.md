# My Personal Blog and Portfolio

Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio project! This project showcases my journey of learning and experimenting with new frontend technologies, particularly Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Through this project, I aim to create a dynamic and visually appealing website that reflects my skills, experiences, and projects.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It provides optimized performance and improved developer experience.
- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid prototyping and efficient styling. It enables me to create responsive and visually appealing designs with ease.
- GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, has been an invaluable tool throughout the development process. It assists in automating repetitive tasks and provides helpful suggestions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `yarn dev`

## Writing Blog Posts

Blog posts in this project are written in Markdown format and stored in the `src/posts/` directory. To add a new blog post, create a new Markdown file following the naming convention `post-title.md` and include the necessary content. The posts will be dynamically rendered on the website.
