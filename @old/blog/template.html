        <h2>Why do I love coding?</h2>

        <p>It's been a long time since I opened a code editor the first time and I started to write my first lines
          of code. Many
          times I was afraid that coding could get boring, but luckily, I have been experiencing something different. As
          time goes
          on I like it more and more and I’m grateful for the fact that coding is part of my job and also is one of my
          favorite
          hobbies.</p>

        <p>It’s always a pleasure for me when the code I write is the solution for a problem. Those experiences
          motivate me to grow
          and to develop my skills. In this way, I can cope with greater challenges. While I am coding, I always feel
          that
          there
          are no limits and I am sure that each problem has a solution. I just need to find the right way to solve the
          given task
          and of course many times I realize that I need to learn something new to get the solution.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I always strive to deliver a clean code. A working code is not enough, the code should be
          easily
          understandable, easy to change and must be maintainable. I always ask for feedback on my work from colleagues
          and on
          different forums. There is always room for improvement, so the other programmers’ opinions are very useful and
          help me
          to grow faster. Even though, for me to get from an empty file to the final version of the code can be wearing,
          I
          enjoy
          all this process.</p>

        <p>Finally, it is also a pleasure for me to read and analyze others` codes, trying to understand and to
          learn something new from it. Sometimes I wonder how many different ways a problem can be solved.</p>

        <p>Here is a question: which one do you prefer? A clean code and partially working product or a code monolith
          and perfectly
          working product?</p>
