## Introduction

It's October, which means it's Hacktoberfest, a perfect time to celebrate open-source! Hacktoberfest is a global event that encourages developers to contribute to open-source projects, making it a great opportunity for me to share my journey. I’ve admired the collaborative spirit of the open-source community for a long time, and this month feels like the ideal time to contribute my first project to the world of open-source.

### TL;DR

This project may be small or seem insignificant, and it likely won't have a major impact. However, I believe it can be helpful to others, and I’m confident it’s a meaningful first step in my journey of contributing to open-source.

## How it all started

My journey into open-source began with my involvement in the [LetsCode.hu](https://letscode.hu) community. I’ve been a part of it since its early days, where I had the chance to meet many talented developers with significant open-source contributions. Their knowledge and passion for sharing their work inspired me and taught me invaluable lessons about the power of open-source.

## Learning from open-source projects

As I progressed in my career, I used more open-source projects in my daily work. These projects, often built by top developers, offered invaluable learning opportunities. Analyzing their high-quality code played a key role in improving my skills and reinforced the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## About my first project

**[samsung-device-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/samsung-device-helper)** is an npm package I developed to provide a comprehensive list of Samsung devices, including phones, tablets, and watches. It includes utility functions to easily retrieve device names by model and to fetch lists of devices by category. I’ve already integrated this library into two of my projects, and it’s proving to be a useful tool for managing Samsung device data efficiently.

## Community and collaboration

One of the biggest motivations behind making this project open-source is the potential for collaboration. I’ve benefited so much from the open-source community and want to give back in any way I can. This project is my way of contributing to the ecosystem that has helped me grow as a developer.

I’d love to hear from you! Do you have any contributions you'd like to make? What advice would you give someone starting their journey in open-source?
