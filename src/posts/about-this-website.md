## Introduction

I have started to develop this page because web development is one of my hobbies and by working on this website I have the possibility to try, learn and experiment with new things.

## Sharing Knowledge and Experiences

I've experienced many things during my professional career, so I decided to share some of my ideas and attempts hoping that some of them can be helpful for someone. I hope you will find them beneficial and interesting. If you consider that I can help you or if you have questions, don't hesitate to contact me, I will try to answer as soon as possible.

## Open Source and Continuous Improvement

You can find the source code of this website on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kulcsarrudolf) profile. I tried to do my best in developing this website according to my current experiences and knowledge. But of course in the future, when I will learn better solutions for it, I will try to refactor it. If you have any suggestions, please share them with me, thank you in advance.
