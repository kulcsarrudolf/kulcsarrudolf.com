        I am a 28 year-old software developer living in Cluj-Napoca. Since I
        remember of my first experience, I have been a big fan of technology,
        and I try to keep up with all the news of its. The most groundbreaking
        experience of my life with coding was when I was 12 years old. I got my
        first professional full-time job as a software developer in 2017.
